                ClassInSight is a project that investigates how smart classrooms can sense in-class activities and provide feedback and training to novice instructors at the college and university level. 
                Currently, the project focuses on helping instructors improve their in-classroom discursive practices, such as asking more content-based questions to increase student participation and engagement.

                Thanks to John Zimmerman at CMU Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Iâ€™m honored to be involved in this amazing project - ClassInsight from Aug 2019 to Dec 2019.

              <P class="project-subtitle">Problem</P>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                In college classrooms, professors often lack comprehensive training in effective teaching methods due to their focus on subject expertise, 
                leading to limited professional development opportunities and time constraints, resulting in challenges such as student participation in class discussions.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                ClassInSight uses sensors to collect data like student attendance, participation, facial expressions, and hand raises in college classrooms. 
                One of the common issues in these contexts is the challenge of getting students to participate in class discussion, especially in technical courses.

                ClassInSight utilizes sensor technology to collect classroom data, including student attendance, participation, facial expressions, and hand raises. 
                To address the issue of overwhelming data, we have developed a three-level data visualization approach based on user research insights.

                After teaching sessions, instructors receive data visualizations along with reflective questions and goal-setting support to facilitate self-reflection, expose them to new strategies, and enhance their teaching practices.

                Working on the ClassInSight project was an exciting experience for me as it involved extensive research, data analysis, and data visualization tasks. 
                It was particularly meaningful to contribute to a user group that I greatly admire.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                One of the key lessons I learned was the importance of identifying and prioritizing relevant data. With the abundance of data collected through ClassInSight's sensors, 
                it was initially challenging to present it all in a meaningful way. However, based on valuable insights from user research, we made the decision to classify the data visualization into three levels, ensuring that the most critical information was presented in an accessible manner. 
                This approach enabled teachers to focus on the essential aspects and derive meaningful insights from the visualizations.
