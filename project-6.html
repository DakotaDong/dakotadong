                ClassInSight is a project that investigates how smart classrooms can sense in-class activities and provide feedback and training to novice instructors at the college and university level. 
                Currently, the project focuses on helping instructors improve their in-classroom discursive practices, such as asking more content-based questions to increase student participation and engagement.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Thanks to John Zimmerman at CMU Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Iâ€™m honored to be involved in this amazing project - ClassInsight from Aug 2019 to Dec 2019.

              <P class="project-subtitle">Problem</P>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Almost all K-12 instructors receive in-depth training on how to teach. This is not true for college, where professors are hired for being content experts, not for being experts on how to teach. 
                Professors have a lot of demands, and not enough time for as much professional development as they would like. 
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                ClassInSight uses sensors to collect data like student attendance, participation, facial expressions, and hand raises in college classrooms. 
                One of the common issues in these contexts is the challenge of getting students to participate in class discussion, especially in technical courses.

            <div class="project-details__desc">
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Solution</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                We use the sensor-driven approach to gather classroom data, such as how much students are talking, how long the wait time is, 
                what types of questions instructors are asking, and so on. It was definitely overwhelming and meaningless to put all of them in one data visualization. 
                According to the insights from user research, we decided to classify data visualization into 3 levels, and represent the most important data in the most accessible way.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                After they are done teaching, we send the instructors data visualizations and ask them questions that support reflection and goal setting, as well as help expose them to new strategies.

                    Medium Level: This view takes priority when teachers look at a single discussion and not a set of discussions.
