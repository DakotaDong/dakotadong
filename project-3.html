                CASEL describes self-awareness as “the ability to accurately recognize one’s own emotions, thoughts, and values and how they influence behavior. 
                The ability to accurately assess one's strengths and limitations, with a well-grounded sense of confidence, optimism, and a growth mindset”. 
                It includes sub competencies like identifying emotions, accurating self-perception, recognizing strength, self-confidence, and self-efficacy.

                The ability to set and work toward personal and academic goals.”

                We then investigated work done by Panorama Education and ACT Tessera. 
                We learned more about how to ask students to reflect on their own behaviors. 
                Panorama Education drafted an open questionnaire with a set of research-backed questions for students to answer, 
                aligning with our idea for daily prompts in Eddie.

                We compared insights from our assessment research to self-awareness and self-management definitions and decided to target six SEL sub competencies.

                We designed a set of prompts under each SEL sub competency. 
                For each one, we developed a set of scientifically supported activities and helpful strategies that come after the prompt. 
                By practicing these activities, students learn how to deal with challenges that may arise in their lives while earning badges for practicing their skills.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                When a student first logs into Eddie, they are prompted to set a time for a daily check-in. 
                Every day at this time, students will get a pop-up window from their SEL buddy, saying it’s time to take a reflection. 
                We found that every student we spoke to would regularly use the app immediately after school or just before school ends to reflect on their day.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                If students don’t set a learning goal, Eddie pushes a random daily prompt to the students. 
                Prompts corresponding to students’ least-developed skills are prioritized.

                After students set a goal for a certain sub competency, Eddie prioritizes new prompts and activities to share with students.

                A digital badge is an indicator of accomplishment or skill that can be displayed, accessed,

                badges are proven to motivate users to participate more.

                In our design, the badge system is embedded in the learner’s profile as a breakthrough in different SEL levels.

                    I used Mongoose to manage relationships between data, provide schema validation, and translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB; bcrypt module for user password hashing; 
                    jsonwebtoken module which can create JSON Web Tokens to mark users as logged in.
