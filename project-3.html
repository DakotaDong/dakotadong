                Our scrollable dashboard incorporates a feature that enables students to monitor their progress in each SEL sub-competency. 
                To ensure clarity and understanding, the definition of each sub-competency is displayed, giving students a clear sense of what they are striving for.

                In Eddie, we provide students with a variety of activities that align with the specific SEL competency relevant to their current page. 
                To encourage regular practice, students receive a daily prompt from the toolbox when they log into Eddie. These prompts are designed to help students actively practice their SEL skills and make progress on their SEL journey.

                These digital badges serve as visible markers of accomplishment and mastery, which can be proudly displayed, accessed, and verified online.

                    On the server side, I used handlers, middleware, and routes to store and handle user information and message information that was sent by users so that our product can allow users to signup/in and view their SEL growth. 
                    I used Mongoose to manage relationships between data, provide schema validation, and translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB; bcrypt module for user password hashing; 
                    jsonwebtoken module which can create JSON Web Tokens to mark users as logged in.

                  <li>
                    On the client side, apart from SEL buddy selection, I created prompts and relevant SEL activities and responses for 3 scenarios. 
                    I used react-router-dom module for web page switch and react-redux to manage user states.
