                Learning to See, Seeing to Learn is an interdisciplinary research and development effort to create an innovative new kind of teaching and learning resource

                Thanks to Marti Louw at CMU Learning Media Design Center, 
                I’m honored to be involved in this amazing project - macroinvertebrates.org from May 2020 to August 2020.

                <strong>What are macroinvertebrates?</strong>
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Macroinvertebrates are small aquatic animals and the aquatic larval stages of insects. 
                In scientific research, macroinvertebrate identification is critical in providing high-quality data for water quality monitoring of local streams, 
                lakes, and other ground water resources.

              <P class="project-subtitle">Problems</P>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Macroinvertebrates.org generates around 2,000 monthly users. 
                20% of them access the website on a mobile device, which results in the website layout breaking on mobile 
                and makes it difficult to take advantage of our most important feature, the zoomable high-res gigpan images. 
              </p>
              <P class="project-subtitle">Main Goals</P>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                The summer 2020 version of the app is an innovative open educational resource with the aim of making the task of learning to identify macroinvertebrate easier 
                and more engaging by developing a robust mobile app.

                The Field Guide is designed with pages that scale across the Order, Family, and Genus taxonomy levels. 
                It is both a reference and learning material with 93 Families within 9 Orders that can be found and learned about.

                The ID Key is a complex web of different paths users can go through to identify unknown insects. 
                Translating the ID Key into the digital space, we have created an innovative, first of its kind key that is mobile friendly and also interactively designed. 
                Various features have been implemented in this section to guide novices in making more confident identifications.

                Content was taken from the glossary on our site but made accessible for handheld devices through the scrollable index.
