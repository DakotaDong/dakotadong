                    Gradual progression: The activities are designed to gradually introduce more specific and complex tasks, such as case studies, after students have gained sufficient experience and familiarity with the subject matter. 
                    This sequencing ensures that students are well-prepared to tackle more advanced challenges and encourages deeper learning.

                    Emphasis on connections and context: Lectures can emphasize links within/between concepts and between processes and the contexts of their use. 
                    Besides, instructional videos provided after the lecture can help students with relatively lower knowledge levels better understand different functions of various modules.

                    Sharing and discussion: The sharing and discussion are about “ideas, issues, or problems” which can create a connection between the conceptual knowledge and the task that students did, 
                    in turn endowing the act of completing a task with deeper meaning than merely handling in an assignment.

                The "HeartRate Box" Engineering Design Process Course has been successfully implemented in over 30 high schools, 
                earning me the first prize in the "iTeach" National College Student Digital Education Application Innovation Competition on 12/02/2018.

                Furthermore, the course content and assessment have been seamlessly integrated into the school's e-learning platform, 
                enabling teachers and school administrators to access and download student reports that provide detailed insights into student learning progress, individual learning journeys, and comparisons across different classes.
