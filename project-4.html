                    Organizing work around provocative questions and challenging problems would be helpful to provoke sustained engagement in learners, activate learners’ prior knowledge, 
                    and inform the instructor about learners’ current knowledge level.

                    The best opening questions (or problems) relate more to very particular tasks such as case studies that can naturally arise after students have had sufficient experience with the issues.

                    Lectures can emphasize links within/between concepts and between processes and the contexts of their use. 
                    Besides, instructional videos provided after the lecture can help students with relatively lower knowledge levels better understand different functions of various modules.

                    The sharing and discussion are about “ideas, issues, or problems” which can create a connection between the conceptual knowledge and the task that students did, 
                    in turn endowing the act of completing a task with deeper meaning than merely handling in an assignment.

                "HeartRate Box" Engineering Design Process Course is applied to more than 30 high schools, 
                which made me win the first prize in “iTeach” National College Student Digital Education Application Innovation Competition on 12/02/2018.

                Also, the course content and assessment has been integrated into the school's e-learning platform, 
                and teachers and school administrators can download different versions of student reports directly. 
                The report for teachers will focus on the comparisons of student learning and the learning journey of every student. 
                While the report for school administrators will be on a general level, for example, showing the comparisons of different classes.
